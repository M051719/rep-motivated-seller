## Engagement Strategy

"💰 How CASH BUYERS Actually Help in Pre-Foreclosure

Let's be 100% transparent about how this works:

📞 STEP 1: FREE CONSULTATION
We look at your situation - what you owe, home condition, timeline. Zero fees.

📄 STEP 2: FAIR CASH OFFER (24-48 hours)
No lowball offers. We show our math and explain exactly how we calculated the price.

📋 STEP 3: WE HANDLE EVERYTHING
• Negotiate with your lender
• Handle ALL paperwork
• Cover closing costs (you pay $0)

⚡ STEP 4: CLOSE FAST (7-21 days)
Traditional sale takes 3-6 months. We close in weeks, sometimes days.

What you get:
✅ No repairs needed
✅ No realtor commissions
✅ No closing costs
✅ Foreclosure STOPPED
✅ Fresh start

REAL TALK: Yes, you might get more selling traditionally. But when foreclosure is looming, time IS money. Every day in pre-foreclosure damages your credit more. Sometimes the "lower" cash offer is actually the smarter financial move when you factor in:
• Avoided foreclosure credit damage
• No repair costs
• No carrying costs (mortgage, utilities, insurance)
• No realtor fees (6-7%)
• No months of stress

We're not for everyone. But if you're facing foreclosure and need OUT fast - this is your path. 🚪

"🔑 QUICK CASH BUYER FAQ:

Q: How do you make money?
A: We buy below market, repair/renovate, then rent or resell. Our profit comes from the work we put in AFTER buying.

Q: Is this a scam?
A: NO. Check our reviews, license, and Better Business Bureau rating. We're a legitimate business.

Q: What if I owe more than the house is worth?
A: We negotiate short sales with lenders. This is our specialty.

Q: How fast can you really close?
A: Record: 5 days. Average: 14 days. It depends on title work and lender approval.

## Trust-Building Strategy

### Transparency Elements to Add:

**In video or caption:**
"💡 FULL TRANSPARENCY: We make money by buying below market value, then investing time/money into repairs and renovations before reselling or renting. Our profit comes from the WORK we do, not from taking advantage of distressed homeowners.

We're not the right fit for everyone. If you have time (3-6 months) and your house is in good shape, a traditional sale might net you more.

But if you're facing foreclosure, need out fast, or have a house needing major repairs - we're your solution."

## FAQ Preparation

**Q: "How much less will I get?"**
A: "Typically 10-20% below market value. But you save 6-7% in realtor fees, repair costs, and carrying costs. Sometimes it's actually similar to a traditional sale when you add it all up."

**Q: "What if my house needs major repairs?"**
A: "That's exactly what we specialize in. Foundation issues, roof problems, fire damage - we buy as-is and handle everything."

**Q: "Can I still get a cash offer if I'm not in foreclosure?"**
A: "Absolutely! Foreclosure is our specialty, but we buy from anyone who needs a fast, hassle-free sale."

**Q: "Do I need a real estate agent?"**
A: "No. We work directly with you. No agent needed means no commission fees."

**Q: "What happens to my security deposit / tenant?"**
A: "We can work with existing tenants or handle the transition. Every situation is different - let's discuss yours specifically."
