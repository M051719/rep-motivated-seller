00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Cash buyers can stop foreclosure
in as little as 7 days.
Here's how it actually works.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First, we evaluate your situation
completely free. No fees, no obligation.
We look at what you owe, the home's
condition, and your timeline.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Within 48 hours, you get a fair
cash offer. No lowballing - we show
exactly how we calculated it.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here's what makes cash buyers different:
We negotiate directly with your lender
for a short sale if needed. We handle
ALL the paperwork. And we cover
closing costs - you pay nothing.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Most important? We close fast.
In as little as 7 days, you're out
from under the mortgage, foreclosure
is stopped, and you can move forward.

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No repairs.
No realtor commissions.
No closing costs.
And foreclosure? Stopped.
