00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What happens after you miss
a mortgage payment?
Here's the exact timeline.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
After one missed payment,
you're in the grace period.
Late fees apply, but you're
not in foreclosure yet.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
By month two, you're officially
in default. Your lender will start
sending notices and may report
to credit bureaus.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
At 90 days, the lender files
a Notice of Default - this is when
pre-foreclosure officially begins.
You still have options!

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Around month 5, a foreclosure
sale date gets scheduled.
But even now, you can
stop the process.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This 90-120 day window is critical -
you have the MOST options
during pre-foreclosure.
