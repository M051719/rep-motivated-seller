00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Facing foreclosure?
A short sale might be
your better option. Here's why.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Credit impact: Short sale drops
your score 50-150 points.
Foreclosure? 200-400 points.
Short sale wins.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Want to buy another home?
After a short sale: 2-4 years.
After foreclosure: 5-7 years.
Clear winner.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The debt? Short sales often forgive it
or make it negotiable. With foreclosure,
lenders can sue you for the difference
between sale price and what you owed.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Control: With a short sale,
YOU negotiate terms.
Foreclosure? The bank
owns the process.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Public records: Short sales show
as 'settled' or 'paid in full for less.'
Foreclosure is a permanent black mark.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Short sale beats foreclosure in
credit impact, future buying power,
debt forgiveness, control,
and public records.
