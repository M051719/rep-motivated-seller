"⚖️ SHORT SALE vs FORECLOSURE: The Numbers Don't Lie

Let's break down which option is better for YOUR future:

🟢 SHORT SALE:
✅ Credit drop: 50-150 points
✅ Buy again in: 2-4 years
✅ Debt: Often forgiven/negotiable
✅ Control: YOU negotiate terms
✅ Record: Shows as "settled"

🔴 FORECLOSURE:
❌ Credit drop: 200-400 points
❌ Buy again in: 5-7 years
❌ Debt: Lender can sue you
❌ Control: Bank owns the process
❌ Record: Permanent public black mark

The winner? SHORT SALE wins on EVERY metric. 🏆

Here's what this means for you:
💰 Less credit damage = easier to rebuild
🏠 Faster path to homeownership again
📄 More dignity and control in the process

## FAQ Preparation

**Q: "Can I do a short sale if I'm already in foreclosure?"**
A: "Yes! You can pursue a short sale right up until the foreclosure sale date. The earlier you start, the better, but it's rarely too late."

**Q: "Won't a short sale still hurt my credit?"**
A: "Yes, but significantly less than foreclosure. Think of it as choosing between a broken bone vs. a bruise - both hurt, but one heals much faster."

**Q: "How long does a short sale take?"**
A: "Typically 60-120 days depending on your lender. We work directly with lenders to expedite the process."

**Q: "Will I owe taxes on forgiven debt?"**
A: "Possibly, but the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act may protect you. This is something we help you understand during consultation."

**Q: "Do I need a realtor for a short sale?"**
A: "As cash buyers, we handle everything directly, including negotiating with your lender. No realtor fees, no commissions."
