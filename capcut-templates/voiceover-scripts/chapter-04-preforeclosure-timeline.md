## Engagement Strategy

**Instagram Caption:**
"⏰ The Pre-Foreclosure Timeline - Know Your Window!

Missed a mortgage payment? Here's EXACTLY what happens next:

📅 Month 1: Grace period (late fees start)
📅 Month 2-3: Default status (credit impact)
📅 Month 4: Notice of Default filed (pre-foreclosure begins)
📅 Month 5: Foreclosure sale scheduled

But here's what most people DON'T know: 

🎯 The 90-120 day window after your first missed payment is when you have the MOST OPTIONS. 

Wait until month 5? Your choices are limited.
Act in month 2-3? You have time to:
✅ Negotiate with lender
✅ Explore loan modification
✅ Consider a cash sale
✅ Avoid foreclosure on your record

Time is literally money in this situation. The earlier you act, the more control you have over the outcome. 💪

## FAQ Preparation

Common questions to address in comments:

**Q: "What if I'm already at day 100?"**
A: "You still have options! Even at day 120+, solutions exist. The key is acting NOW. DM us for specifics to your situation."

**Q: "Will this hurt my credit?"**
A: "After 30 days, late payments can be reported. But foreclosure impacts credit FAR more than exploring alternatives early. We can discuss credit-protective options."

**Q: "Can I still sell my house?"**
A: "Absolutely! Many homeowners in pre-foreclosure successfully sell to cash buyers and avoid foreclosure entirely. That's our specialty."

**Q: "What if I can't afford a lawyer?"**
A: "Many HUD-approved counselors offer FREE guidance. Our consultation is also free. Never let cost stop you from getting help."
