Hi [First Name],

I’d love to better understand your current situation and help you explore real options to avoid foreclosure or improve your mortgage terms. Please reply with answers to the following questions:

1. How long have you lived in your current home?
2. Are you behind on payments or just anticipating trouble?
3. Have you received any foreclosure notices?
4. What’s been the biggest challenge in catching up?
5. What would resolving this issue mean to you personally?

If you’d prefer a quick phone call, reply with the best time and number to reach you.
